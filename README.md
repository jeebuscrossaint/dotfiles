## Welcome to the shlawg!

These are my dotfiles. I hope the name the shlawg did not dissuade any employers as that would be unfortunate.
All you need to do is clone the repo and run the installer. So basically the only dependency is git.
```
git clone https://www.github.com/jeebuscrossaint/theshlawg
cd theshlawg/
./installer.sh
```
If you encounter any difficulty please make an issue request here and if the script does something unexpected, just hit Ctrl+C to exit it. Follow the instructions the script says  ***strictly***.

Thanks!
