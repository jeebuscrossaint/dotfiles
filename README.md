# [jeebuscrossaint] (https://github.com/jeebuscrossaint)'s dotfiles

## Welcome to ~/dotfiles 

** These are my dotfiles which are configuration files for many different applications. I spent some time on them. They may not be for everyone. **

## Tree

** The windows folder will contain Microsoft Windows related configuration files and a powershell script at some point to do stuff. The Macos folder has nothing yet because I don't have a Mac (thankfully). The linux-bsd folder has you guessed it linux and bsd related configuration files, which are more unix friendly. **

## Install

** I will write an install script soon which will contain stuff related to linux-bsd configuration installation. **

Do note that the configuration files were made for either Arch Linux, Void Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD. Usually I'm on Void Linux though which by the way doesn't use systemd but rather runit.
